# Static Assets Modules

This repo contains modules for managing static assets (CSS, JS, images) in GCP.

## Updates

This project was forked from the great work that Gruntwork has done and has been extended to include new functionality.

- Custom Header Support Added for Buckets

```text
# Accepts a list of headers
variable "custom_headers" {
  description = "A list of custom Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied responses"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["Referrer-Policy: origin"]
}
```

## Quickstart

If you want to quickly launch a static website using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/),
you can run the example that is in the root of this repo. Check out the [cloud-storage-static-website example documentation](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/examples/cloud-storage-static-website) for instructions.

## What's in this repo

This repo has the following folder structure:

- [root](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/tree/master): The root folder contains an example of how to launch a static website using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). See [cloud-storage-static-website example documentation](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/examples/cloud-storage-static-website) for the documentation.

- [modules](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/modules): This folder contains the main implementation code for this Module.

  The primary modules are:

  - [cloud-storage-static-website](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/modules/cloud-storage-static-website):
    The Cloud Storage Static Website module is used to create a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
    bucket that can be used to host a [static website](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website).

  - [http-load-balancer-website](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/modules/http-load-balancer-website):
    The HTTP Load Balancer Website module is used to create a [HTTP Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/)
    that routes requests to a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) bucket for static content hosting,
    allowing you to also configure SSL with a custom domain name.

- [examples](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the submodules.

- [test](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and examples.

## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/simplycubed/terraform-google-static-assets/releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
